# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 and Pygame installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git`
3. Navigate into the project directory: `cd snake-game`
4. Run the game: `python game.py`

## How to Play

The game starts with a small snake. The objective is to eat the food (randomly placed in the playing area), which makes the snake longer. The game ends if the snake hits the screen boundary or hits itself.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- The speed of the snake increases as it eats more food, making the game more challenging.
- The game displays the current score, which is the number of food items eaten by the snake.
